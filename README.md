# Qrator - Frontend
(Ref: Gary Axel Muliyono)

A simple Vite + React + Typescript project to talk about topics. It communicates with a backend made with Go + Docker.

You can visit [this website](https://cvwo-frontend-salmonkarp.netlify.app/) for the newest active deployment.
The backend can be visited [here](https://github.com/salmonkarp/CVWO-Backend), which has been deployed onto AWS EC2.

## Quickstart / How to Use
1. Visit the application through the [link provided](https://cvwo-frontend-salmonkarp.netlify.app/).
2. You should be prompted to login. You can use any reasonable username, which will be auto-registered if it's not already. If the system rejects the username, error messages will appear instructing you on how to fix it.
3. You should see a dashboard that looks like this:

4. Enjoy! You can start browsing through topics, viewing posts, and replying to posts and comments.

## Use of AI
The main generative AI tools used to assist in this project are ChatGPT and Github Copilot. They were used to:
- Obtain advice on initial project design & structure, mainly for the backend.
- Refactor some functions to separate files for clealiness of code.
- Fix a number of bugs, after online information was not able to help in fixing them
